Caml-Shcaml brings high-level abstractions for Unix systems and shell
programming to OCaml. In particular, it takes advantage of OCaml's type
system to offer statically-checked data pipelines. External Unix
processes and internal OCaml stream transducers communicate seamlessly
within these pipelines. Shcaml brings other essential systems concepts
into the world of typed functional programming as well, including
high-level interfaces to Unix facilities for I/O redirection, signal
handling, program execution, and subprocess reaping. For more
