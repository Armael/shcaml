Caml-Shcaml 0.1.1
-----------------

- [05 Feb 2008] Sed script used to build documentation is now portable;
  no longer relies on GNU sed.

- [05 Feb 2008] Now supports (and in fact requires) OCaml 3.10.  (Should
  we somehow make it work in both?  Seems like a pain.)

- [07 Aug 2007, 05 Feb 2008] pa_linetype now supports anonymous row
  variables, such as <| .. >.  When the entire row is anonymous, it
  expands to < .. > rather than a list of fields.

- [15 Aug 2007] Several places that used to use ints for process statuses
  now use Proc.status instead.
