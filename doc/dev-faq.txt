Why do all the line types in the sources look like <Line| .. as 'a >
instead of <| .. as 'a >?

    Expanding the <| > syntax requires generating identifiers that refer
    to types and values in the Shcaml.Line module, such as
    Shcaml.Line.present.  End-users see the Line module as nested inside
    the Shcaml module, so syntax/pa_linetype.ml generates the
    identifiers qualified with Shcaml.Line.  However, when compiling our
    code, we haven't packed into Shcaml yet, so we need to tell
    pa_linetype.ml to leave off the leading Shcaml.
