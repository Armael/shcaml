INSTALLING CAML-SHCAML
08/02/2007

Caml-Shcaml requires findlib and the pcre package (as well as the camlp4 and
unix packages, which are provided by Ocaml and findlib).

To build and install:

    % gunzip shcaml-VERSION.tar.gz
    % tar xf shcaml-VERSION.tar
    % cd shcaml-VERSION
    % ./configure
    % make
    % make install

If your findlib is installed as root, you may need to "sudo make install".

You can find Caml-Shcaml's documentation online at <?>, or build a local copy
(HTML and man pages) with

    % make docs

This will put HTML documentation in doc/html (start with index.html) and man
pages in doc/man.
