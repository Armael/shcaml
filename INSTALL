INSTALLING CAML-SHCAML
Sat, 16 Apr 2011 23:16:00 -0400

Caml-Shcaml requires findlib and the pcre package (as well as the camlp4 and
unix packages, which are provided by Ocaml and findlib).

To build and install:

    % gunzip shcaml-VERSION.tar.gz
    % tar xf shcaml-VERSION.tar
    % cd shcaml-VERSION
    % ./configure
    % make
    % make install

If your findlib is installed as root, you may need to "sudo make install".

(NOTE: The configure script ignores --prefix and other installation
location arguments, since it uses ocamlfind for installation.  To change
the install location, it's probably best to invoke ocamlfind manually.)

You can find Caml-Shcaml's documentation online at

    http://www.ccs.neu.edu/~tov/code/shcaml/doc/

or build a local copy (HTML and man pages) with

    % make docs

This will put HTML documentation in doc/html (start with index.html) and man
pages in doc/man.
