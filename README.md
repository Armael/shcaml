# Shcaml

Shcaml is an OCaml library for Unix shell programming.

Unix shells provide easy access to Unix functionality such as pipes, signals,
file descriptor manipulation, and the file system. Shcaml hopes to excel at
these same tasks.

## Installation

Shcaml can be installed with `opam`:

    opam install shcaml

If you don't use `opam` consult the [`opam`](opam) file for build
instructions.

## Documentation & tutorial

You can find Shcaml's documentation (including a tutorial) online at
http://tov.github.io/doc/shcaml or build a local copy with `make
doc`.
